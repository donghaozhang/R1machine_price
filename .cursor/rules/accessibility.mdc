# Accessibility Features

The R1 Machine Price Calculator includes several accessibility features to ensure it works well for all users.

## Form Element Accessibility

All form elements in [index.html](mdc:index.html) have proper accessibility attributes:
- Input fields have `title` and `aria-label` attributes
- Select elements have `title` and `aria-label` attributes
- Buttons have clear, descriptive text

## Semantic HTML

The application uses semantic HTML elements appropriately:
- `<table>` for tabular data with proper `<thead>` and `<tbody>` sections
- `<label>` elements properly associated with form inputs
- Headings used in the correct hierarchical order

## Color Contrast

The styles in [styles.css](mdc:styles.css) ensure sufficient color contrast:
- Dark text on light backgrounds
- Button colors that provide adequate contrast with their text

## Responsive Design

The layout is responsive and works well on different screen sizes:
- Table becomes scrollable on small screens
- Exchange rate inputs stack vertically on mobile
- All interactive elements remain usable at various screen sizes
