# UI Components Structure

The R1 Machine Price Calculator uses a simple but effective UI structure.

## Main Container

[index.html](mdc:index.html) contains a main container div that holds the entire application.

## Exchange Rate Section

The top section contains input fields for exchange rates:
- USD to CNY
- AUD to CNY
- AUD to USD

These inputs have event listeners that trigger recalculation when values change.

## Components Table

The central element is a table with columns for:
- Component name
- Quantity
- Unit price
- Currency selector
- Total prices in USD, AUD, and CNY
- Action buttons (Delete)

The table includes a special last row for subtotals.

## Action Buttons

The "Add Component" button adds new rows to the table.

## Styling

[styles.css](mdc:styles.css) provides:
- Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
- Clean, modern appearance with appropriate colors
- Proper spacing and alignment of elements
- Hover effects for interactive elements
