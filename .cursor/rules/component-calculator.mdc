# Component Price Calculation Logic

The price calculation system converts between currencies and calculates totals for all components.

## Exchange Rates

These are defined in the UI and can be adjusted by the user:
- USD to CNY: Default 7.2950
- AUD to CNY: Default 5.5513
- AUD to USD: Default 0.7604

## Calculation Flow

1. When a component's details change (quantity, price, currency):
   - The row calculations are triggered in [script.js](mdc:script.js) (see `calculateRow()` function)
   - Prices are converted between all three currencies
   - Row totals are updated
   
2. When any row is changed or deleted:
   - The subtotal is recalculated for all currencies
   - See `calculateSubtotal()` function in [script.js](mdc:script.js)

3. When exchange rates are modified:
   - All rows are recalculated with new rates
   - The subtotal is updated accordingly
   
## Adding New Components

When adding a new component with the "Add Component" button:
1. A new row is created in the table
2. Event listeners are attached to the row's inputs
3. The row is initialized with default values
4. Calculations are performed immediately to show initial totals
